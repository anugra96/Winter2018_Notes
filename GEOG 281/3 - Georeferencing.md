# GEOREFERENCING



## Cartographic Abstraction

### 5 Stages of Map Making:

1. **Selection** of the few features in the real world to include
2. **Simplification** involving elimination, aggregation, smoothing
3. **Exaggeration and Displacement** of features to be included that are too small to show at the scale of the map
4. **Classification** or other attribute data manipulation (to reduce complexity and organize mapped information for communication)
5. **Symbolization** to represent the different classes of features chosen



## Types of Maps

Two broad classes of maps:

### Topographic Map

a reference map tool, showing natural and cultural geographic features

- **cultural features**: roads, buildings, boundaries, railways, power lines
- **water**: lakes, rivers, streams, swamps, rapids
- **elevation**: contour lines indicate mountains, valleys, slopes, depressions
- **vegetation**: wooded and cleared areas, vineyards and orchards
- **toponymy**: place names, water feature names, highway names

### Thematic Map

displays spatial patterns of a theme or series of attributes

- tool to communicate geographical concepts such as the distribution of population densities, climate, movement of goods, land use etc.
